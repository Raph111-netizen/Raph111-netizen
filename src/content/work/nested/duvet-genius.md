My journey into the world of video production began at the age of 13, fueled by my passion for extreme sports. Capturing my adrenaline-fueled exploits on camera, I quickly developed a knack for filming and editing. What started as a hobby gradually morphed into a budding profession as I upgraded my equipment and honed my skills with advanced editing software.
As a teenager, this passion turned into a profitable venture. I began creating music videos, capturing the dynamic energy of sports competitions, concerts, and travel adventures, eventually branching out into various media forms. This evolution of my craft led me to professionally embrace video production as my career in 2019.
Working as a freelancer, I collaborated with prominent communication agencies, including BMV, known for their work with the Stade Toulousain. These experiences not only sharpened my technical expertise but also broadened my understanding of storytelling through visuals.
Gradually, my video work led me to explore the broader field of communication, intertwining my academic background in History, my experience in commerce, and my fervor for new technologies. This unique blend of skills and interests allowed me to create compelling, narrative-driven content that resonates with diverse audiences, solidifying my place in the ever-evolving world of digital communication.
